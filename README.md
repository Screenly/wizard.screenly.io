Wizard is a network configuration wizard for Screenly Pro.

The goals are to simplify network configuration and system configurations for Screenly Pro deployments in a secure fashion.

Since security is an issue for many users, we have decided to make the tool fully open source and host it on Github. Moreover, everything is done in the browser, which means that no credentials are sent to our servers.
